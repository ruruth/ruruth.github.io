_The music streaming industry is highly competitive and for Spotify to keep its number one position in terms of subscribers, it must innovate on a constant basis. Needless to say, Spotify has arrived at this position primarily due to its business strategy and technical tools and can only remain there by constantly evolving._<br>

## Why the Need for a Change<br>
Our objective is to sell to Spotify, a project pertaining to the improvement of the recommendation engine they currently use in order to enhance the user’s chances of discovering new musical tastes. <br>
The presently used collaborative filtering algorithm recommends to the existing users, songs that have been listened to by users who have similar musical tastes as them; if it is a new user who does not have any history, they are recommended popular songs based on geography, language and personal identity information etc. In this work, we focus on drastically improving the algorithm used for recommending songs to existing users. We will develop a new algorithm based on modifying the Collaborative Filtering algorithm that Spotify uses. The new algorithm will recommend playlists based not only on the listener’s tastes but also songs that will enable the listener to discover new tastes.<br>
